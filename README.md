# DelphiIMAPI2Burning
my open-source library for burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs using Delphi. I developed this library back in 2015 for an internal project and noticed that there weren't many similar libraries available online. So, I've decided to share it on GitHub to help other Delphi developers with their burning needs.

My library, called IMAPI2 Windows Burning, supports a range of disc types, including CD, DVD, BDR, CD-RW, DVD-RW, and ISO creation. I admit that some parts of the library may need to be refactored to make them more user-friendly. Moreover, I've learned some best practices for coding since I developed the library, so I plan to update the code accordingly.

I've also created a demo for the library, I hope that this library will be helpful to other developers looking for a solution to their burning needs.

Finally, I want to note that my library uses DevExpress for the ComboBox compilation with drive icons. 

if you want to use devexpresses with the CxImageCoboBox which provides the system images in the device combo, use the USE_DEVEXPRESS compilation directive
